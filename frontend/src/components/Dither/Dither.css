/* If we want mouse interaction, we need pointer-events auto, but z-index -1 might block clicks?
   Actually, if it's z-index -1, it will be behind everything.
   If we want it to be interactive, we might need a different approach or just accept it's background. 
   But the user asked for "Dither", which implies the effect. The effect has mouse interaction.
   If it's behind everything, mouse interaction might not work if other elements obstruct it.
   However, usually for a background, we want it to be -1.
   Let's see. pointer-events: none on the canvas container allows clicks to pass through to content.
   BUT if we want the wave to react to mouse, we need it to receive events? 
   No, usually threejs canvas needs to be on top to receive events OR we listen to window events.
   The current implementation uses `onPointerMove` on a mesh. That mesh needs to be hittable.
   If it's z-index -1, the body/content will be on top and consume events.
   We can just set pointer-events: none on the container, but maybe the Dither component listens to global mouse?
   Looking at Dither.jsx: `onPointerMove` is on a mesh. So it relies on raycasting/pointer events on the canvas.
   If we put it behind, it won't receive events if content covers it.
   For now, I'll set z-index: -1. Implicitly, we might lose mouse interaction where content is. 
   That's probably acceptable for a background.
